              </span>
            </p>
            <span>My top 5:<div>1. Cao Dong - has basically won all there is to win. I hope that now he has more time to analyze and playe renju since he became a renju teacher. </div><div>2. Vladimir Sushkov - it is definitely hard to understand his strength when you do not know him well. Actually, he is a complete player - good physical skills, calculation skills, very strong at making analyses, good nerves, so on and so forth. In my opinion, if he had more time (his work is very intense), he would be the number 1. </div><div>3. Dai Xiaohan - Very humble guy. He said that he thinks he his old but I think that his best years are ahead of him (he has only played renju for 8 years, I think it takes at least 10 years to get to a very high level but he is already there). This world championship was very hard for him (first international tournament, 18 games in 10 days etc.) but he still managed to get the 5th place. </div><div>4. Wu Di - Never underestimate the world champion! His first big tournament win in China just showed that when he is motivated, he can still beat the shit out of everybody. In his case, it is the same with Sushkov: if he had more time, he would be higher on this list. </div><div>5. Tunnet Taimla - It is a big disgrace how this guy has wasted his talents (last time he seriously played renju was 2003 - what a coincidence, he became the world champion that year!)especially take into consideration that he has the time and money to do it (he has made a very good living by playing poker). Still, you should never underestimate him and he is always capable of winning every single tournament that he enters. </div><div>From the outside looking in: Huang Jinxian and Li Yi - the 2 best young players in China, both showed exceptional results in their first foreign tournaments (Li Yi got the best results on the 1st table in 2010 TWC and Huang got he 3rd place in 2011 AT). Still, I would like to see them getting a top 3 result in an individual important Chinese tournament first (also, they are quite busy as I have understood, Li Yi with his work and Huang with his university studies). Still, they have all the time in the world to get there, they are already very close at such a yong age!</div><div>Honorary mention:</div><div>Nakamura Shigeru: I talked with the current meijin, Oosumi, and he told me that renju is only in 6th place in his life (I think it was something like this: women, going to hot springs, gambling, beer, I forgot the last thing)! So, that he is able to show such good results at his age, unbelievable! This truly makes him a living legend.</div><p><font color="red"> ［ 屏蔽 于 2011-9-3 8:51:18 时花20金币送鲜花一朵］</font></p></span>

            <span>many years later when the chinese players talk about who is the strongest player in the world ,more of us will think is NAKAMURA or Ando ,and the player in other country didn`t know any chinese players but now more and more players know that the best players is in China .and the most important is not only one player ,it is  a group ! <br/></span>

              <p>Mr.Cao is capable to stand on the top 5, i think he deserve it after what he had done in AT tournament few weeks ago. </p>
              <p>Mr.Wu is a powerful, strong renju player, when i say that it's not just on mentally also his physical appearance. The most important thing is he is a man with his words. Not to mention he had a championship before. </p>
              <p>I am not saying that Dai is not able to compete with these two players above, perhaps Dai just need more experience. </p>
              <p>To Dai's fans, Dai is one of my favorite renju players, and we're from same province in China, there is nothing personal against him. </p>

            <span>Definitely, World Champion title matters. Still, Dai just did not have a chance to participate before (he wanted to in 2009 but you all know what happened...). Also, it does not really matter if it is RIF or Yamaguchi rules since both of these rules suck (Taraguchi-10 is the best of the current certified rules atm, at least for live play, unfortunately, there is not a single place where you can play with it (well, it is almost the same as Soosyrv-10, which is such a wonderful rule, too! Freedom (T-10, S-10) vs imprisonment (old RIF, Yamaguchi) ), I will try to tell the renjuoffline owner to put it there). If you count Dai's titles, it more than enough compensates for the lacking world champion title, at least in my opinion. About Ando: he will come back to Estonia next summer and he said that maybe, maybe, he will start to  think about playing a little. About Chingin: he actually came to watch AT for 1 day, later, me, Tunnet, Sushkov and him went to have a dinner together, it was really nice to see him once again after 3 years, unfortunately, he said that he has no plans, at least right now (he could easily take part in tournaments since he is working in Stockholm as a scientist), to join a tournament, still, he said he might give the local renju club a visit. About Nakamura: he promised me that he will come to TWC in Beijing (well, he was quite drunk when he made the promise), to see his good friend Cao Dong. I hope he his the kind of man who keeps his promises! Actually, it is hard to define young, I think I am not young anymore, also, I cannot take part in any youth renju tournaments (for example, Huang Jinxian and Li Yi could still take part in next year's Youth World Championship in Russia, Suzdal).</span>
