              <p>A Way to Improvement of player's standard</p>
              <p>By Alexander Nosovsky (Part 1)<br/>Many new clubs and new players have appeared recently and they all are going to<br/>repeat , the way from a little club to a big one, from a beginner to a master.<br/>It is known that besides a good player beginners progress and achieve his level more<br/>quickly. However, improvement of player's standard stops when a club stops its<br/>contacts with "the outer world". That is why it seems useful to me to describe the way<br/>of standard's improvement. To point out some defects, typical for certain stages, to<br/>give some advice.<br/>#1 From a Beginner to a Master<br/>Acquainting himself with renju , every beginner likes combinations, though they are<br/>not complicated yet, just 2-3 fours. He often makes fours even without any use,<br/>without seeing the victory.<br/>This stage can be described in two words in such a way : a threat - a defense, no<br/>defense - a defeat.<br/>The second stage of acquainting with the game begins at the moment when the<br/>beginner starts preparing the winning combinations instead of just putting into<br/>practice the combination he has noticed.<br/>Here, a typical method is making a three, which the opponent can stop only in one<br/>way and hoping he will make a mistake.<br/>The next stage is distinguished by the ability to carry out combinations consisting of<br/>5-7 moves. However, being carried away with combinations the player forgets about<br/>the necessity of defense. And as it often happens, at the culminating point of<br/>completing the combination with a three, the opponents VCF comes.<br/>As a rule, this is the last stage in education of an amateur player, a typical<br/>representative of the no organized renju. Practically every player joining a renju club<br/>has some defects of these stages.<br/>Joining the club, he learns renju rules. The first response to forbidden moves rules -<br/>What are they for ?<br/>Actually, these rules has not been necessary at the described stages, but it is simply a<br/>must for further improvement of skill.<br/>Beginning to play with forbidden moves, the player polishes his ability to choose the<br/>right order of winning moves (when playing black) and the ability of thinking for the<br/>opponent, seeing his combinations (when playing white). It is rather difficult to<br/>understand the rules of forbidden moves in details, especially if there is neither<br/>literature nor a good player beside.<br/>But without a detailed understanding of forbidden moves you can't be even a good<br/>crosses&amp; noughts player. It is necessary to remember that it is not the superficial<br/>resemblance to a three or a four, but the possibility of their turning into a five, that<br/>matters.<br/>As I have already pointed out, the further improvement of player's standard is possible<br/>mostly in clubs and it is necessary to master the ability of planning and preparing<br/>combinations. At this stage, the player learns typical combinations, and then, learns to<br/>create corresponding typical situations in his own games. The defects of the first<br/>stages are also eliminated at this stage. The player studies many problems and thus<br/>prepares the basis for developing his ability to think out combinations in games.<br/>It is a very important stage (approximately corresponding to 5 kyu) and the<br/>seriousness of player's attitude to renju is tested at it. Players with no aptitude, players<br/>who don't consider renju to be a sport, drop out.<br/>They usually don't study either literature or theory, leave tournaments and don't pay<br/>member's fees. Experience shows that their interest for renju decrease after 2-3<br/>months and after a couple of years they go out of renju's sight even if the work in the<br/>club is organized in the best possible way.<br/>It is interesting that after the first acquaintance with forbidden moves almost all the<br/>playe</p>
